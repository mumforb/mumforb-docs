# Gitlab Vulnerability Report

The Gitlab Vulnerability report takes the output of security scanners (either provided by Gitlab or custom-made) and presents the findings in a dashboard inside each project, and also collates the findings in each group.

The vulnerability report will automatically post the findings of a scan if it is in the correct format, and run against the default branch of a repository. If a custom scanner is used, the output must be configured in the Gitlab CI file to place the output in the correct location (see example below), and be of the correct format.
